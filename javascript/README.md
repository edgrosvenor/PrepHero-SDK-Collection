# PrepHero - a Javascript Toolkit to get access PrepHero.com

This library was written by Xinjiang Shao <Xinjiang.Shao@exactsports.com> in July 2012.


## Features
* It is a OAuth2 Client, not OAuth1 Client. It uses Implict Grant Flow.



## Dependencies
We used JQuery to do AJAX call, and Google Web Toolkit to do OAuth2 authentication.
So you need to include jQuery and gwt-oauth2.js in your application.

## Demo

There is a simple demo located in demo/index.php. You could take a look to get started.
